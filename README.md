## 📖 About me

### 👋 **Hello!**  
  I'm Seoyeon Kim, a frontend developer passionate about crafting engaging web experiences.

<br>

### 🌍 **My Journey**  
  I began my career in communications in both public and private sectors, where I gained valuable insights and experiences in communication and project management. After my stint in communications, I transitioned into tech, driven by a desire to create user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. I’ve accumulated over two years of experience in frontend development.

<br>

### 💼 **Current Role**  
  I’m currently working at a travel startup, developing frontend solutions for platforms that offer curated hotels and tour activities based on user preferences. Using React and Next.js, I optimized SEO for the service and significantly increased the clickthrough rate (CTR).

<br>

### 💻 **Technical Skills**  
  I specialize in optimizing user experiences and SEO, with strong proficiency in TypeScript, React, and Next.js. (And Tailwind! I love it 🥰) I enjoy leveraging these technologies to build beautiful, responsive, and performance-optimized websites.

<br>

### 🎓 **Continuous Learning**  
 I hold a Master’s degree in International Relations from Ewha Woman’s University. After discovering my passion for frontend development, I began learning on my own and later completed a software programming bootcamp. To deepen my knowledge, I plan to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in the near future.

<br>

### 🌟 **What I Value**  
  I am passionate about creating intuitive and efficient workflows, whether for user-facing applications or internal tools. Collaboration and knowledge sharing are key aspects of my work philosophy.

<br>

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me!
